Homer Simpson

Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield and the protagonist of the animated television series The Simpsons.

He is a crude, ignorant, and slobbish individual, although he is fundamentally a good person and shows great caring and loyalty to his family, friends and on occasion, to those he barely knows or those he considers his enemies.



Lisa Simpson

Lisa Marie Simpson is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary.[10] In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words", she called herself Lisa Bouvier after estranging herself from her father after he bet against her in a crossword tournament.
